## How to cite

It is possible to use Markdown/Pandoc style to cite any reference e.g. book, journal paper, conference ... etc. Just make sure to add the reference's `BibTex` index to `assets/myref.bib` file, then call its header as follows: `[@altowayan2016word]`. LaTeX format is possible as well e.g. `\cite{altowayan2016word}`

After compiling the final document it will generate this linked reference [@altowayan2016word]


## How to change specific format

To change the layout or format of any component in the pdf document e.g. tables layout or figures position ... etc, one will need to edit the LaTeX template file `assets/default.latex` to add and/or modify the desired output.
